If you would like to contribute, here are some notes and guidelines\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item All new development happens on feature/fix branches, and are then merged to the {\ttfamily master} branch once stable; so the {\ttfamily master} branch is always the most up-\/to-\/date, working code
\item Tagged releases are made from the {\ttfamily master} branch
\item If you are going to be submitting a pull request, please fork from {\ttfamily master}, and submit your pull request back as a fix/feature branch referencing the Git\+Hub issue number
\item Code style might be automatically fixed by {\ttfamily composer fix}
\item All code changes must be validated by {\ttfamily composer check}
